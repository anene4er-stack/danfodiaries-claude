- Example journaling reflection endpoint
- Example chat endpoint

Quick start

   cp .env.example .env
2. Add your Anthropic API key to `.env`:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Start the app:
   npm start
   or use development mode:
   npm run dev

Endpoints
- GET /health
- GET /
- POST /api/chat
- POST /api/journal/reflect

Example: journal reflection request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/journal/reflect \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "Reflection on today",
    "mood": "hopeful",
    "content": "I finally completed a difficult task and felt proud of myself. I still have a lot to do, but I feel more confident than I did yesterday."
  }'

Example: chat request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Help me write a short, encouraging journal conclusion for today.",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a supportive journaling assistant for DanfoDiaries."
  }'

Notes
- The app uses the Anthropic Messages API and supports `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` by default.
- You can change the model in `.env` with `CLAUDE_MODEL`.
- For production, add auth, rate limiting, and request validation.
